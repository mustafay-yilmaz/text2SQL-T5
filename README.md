## SQL Query Generation System using Natural Language

### Source Code
- Developed a project leveraging T5 transformers from Hugging Face for fine-tuning, trained on a dataset to perform natural language to SQL query conversion.
- Utilized system analysis tools, including class, sequential, and E-R diagrams, to guide the project to successful completion.
- Implemented functionalities to extract SQL queries from natural language input, as well as translation from Turkish to English, using Python and T5 transformers.
- Integrated the system with a GUI using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter module, allowing users to generate SQL queries by inputting either Turkish or English sentences.

### Installation
